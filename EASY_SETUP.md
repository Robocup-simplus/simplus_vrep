The installation is based on 2 approaches; 
- in the first approach the Game Manager & the Robot Controlling Code are placed in the same file which could be useful for training)
- in the second approach the Game Manager & the Robot Controlling Code are placed in different files by a Client/Server senario and the connection is based on ports which makes it suitable for competition).

> It should be noted that the for now using the Scratch is just available through the second approach.  

> Since the approach2 uses ports to communicate, and several ports might be left open by the previously ran programs, it is advised to run the `clear.sh`, `clear.bat`, & `clear.sh` with respect to your OS before each run.

# macOS  
In order to make the setup process easier, some applications and scripts are created. You can choose using applications or scripts .The Applications will be run by duoble clicking on them and you can find the current running application list on the mac's top menu.
  
  ![Applications status](docs/img/mac_runpackage.png?raw=true "Applications status")

You can close this applications using 'close' icon near them.
Please Choose One of the two provided setup approaches. Two V-rep Simulator versions are available in each approach.
# Using Application
## Installation
Download the [installer Application](https://github.com/Robocup-simplus/simplus_vrep/raw/master/easy_setup/mac/installer.zip) and choose your interested V-rep version.
- ### Using V-rep version 4 (CoppeliaSim)
  ```bash
     Double click on the "installer_v4" application and the server will be installed on the Desktop directory
    (You will recieve a dialog pop up at the end of the installation process).
  ```
- ### Using V-rep version 3.6.2
  ```bash
   Double click on the "installer" application and the server will be installed on the Desktop directory
  (You will recieve a dialog pop up at the end of the installation process).
  ```

- In case you face any error use [installer_full Application](https://github.com/Robocup-simplus/simplus_vrep/raw/master/easy_setup/mac/installer_full.zip) and Double click on it's corresponding version.

## World setup
- ### Using V-rep version 4 (CoppeliaSim)
  ```bash

## World setup

### Using V-rep version 4 (CoppeliaSim)

Run the bat file in `simplus_vrep-master/easy_setup/windows/simulator_v4.bat`.

### Using V-rep version 3.6.2
Run the bat file in `simplus_vrep-master/easy_setup/windows/simulator.bat` .

## Run 
There is two methods to communicate with the robot:

Approach1: is based on V-rep python API (there is no client and server & the robot controling code should be placed in the main function of `robotApi.py`.),

Approach2: is based on remote API (the teams should use `client.py` to control robot) 

> Remember to Stop the V-REP Simulator (by the V-REP Stop bottom) & Play agein (by the V-REP Start bottom) before starting a new Run.

### Approach1
- run `run1.bat`
### Approach 2
- run `run2_client.bat`
- run `run2-server.bat`

# Setup for Scratch
Based on your desired operating system go through steps abow and chose the **Approach2 & skip the client part** (since the client would be the Scratch program), then follow the below steps: 
1. Go to  https://scratchx.org/?url=https://Robocup-simplus.github.io/simplus.js#scratch  (wait till the extention loads)
2. Simplus blocks are located in "More Blocks" tab and you can drag and drop them to the right scene
3. In order to use the sample project, from the top menu click on  `File` then `load project` and select the `simplus_scratch.sbx` file from `simplus_vrep/client/scratch`
